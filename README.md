Volatility and Trading Market Behavior of Reliance Industries Limited: A Cross-market investigation
Abstract : The study investigates the trading patterns of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) across two major venues – Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and London Stock Exchange (LSE). By analyzing 10- minute midpoint returns over a two-month sample (January-February 2025). Through the study I aim to understand the dynamics of cross-border trading and the implications for liquidity and price discovery. The data pipeline consists of: (I) mapping each metric onto session-overlap windows; (ii) aligning all price series on a common UTC 10-minute grid;(iii) market microstructure considerations ;(iv) risk metrics development. Empirical results show significant tail-risk clustering during the overlapping hours of BSE and LSE. This further highlights the importance of adjusting to real-time price and liquidity on Reliance’s trading behavior.
